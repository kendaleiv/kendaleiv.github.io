I've had a great year with some great accomplishments, including:

- Started speaking **in public**! I delivered a talk at NYC Code Camp, two at Harrisburg .Net Code Camp, and one at BarCamp Harrisburg *(the BarCamp is an unconference, but, I had prepared materials. And, attendees.)*.
- Started blogging. You're reading it.
- Initial committer and currently core contributor for two .NET open source projects. Thanks to [Ritter Insurance Marketing](https://www.ritterim.com/) for supporting this work and OSS!
- Authored my first [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package: [keepass-keepasshttp](https://chocolatey.org/packages/keepass-keepasshttp). It's getting downloads too!
- Bought a house -- it's very nice.
- Worshipped with a good amount of improvisational violin.
- Tried jalape√±o wine at a Renaissance Faire. I'm not a fan.

This year was about me stretching myself and doing some new things. Next year I expect a similar list of items, but bigger and better.

2014, you've been amazing, but I'm excited to see what 2015 has to offer!

title: Operating A Wi-Fi Enabled Robot Vacuum / Mop During A Home Internet Outage Using A Smartphone Hotspot
---

Robot vacuums / mops are a convenient way to clean your home. If they are typically operated using Wi-Fi functionality may be limited during an internet outage.

**You can use your smartphone hotspot to get full functionality back during an internet outage by having a smartphone become the Wi-Fi network used by the robot vacuum / mop.**

## Instructions

1. Turn off the existing Wi-Fi network *(to avoid confusion with your phone hotspot network)*.
2. Turn on your phone hotspot set up to match the exact Wi-Fi network band, SSID (network name), and password. If you're unfamiliar with setting up a hotspot using your phone search online for information specific to your device.
3. Use your robot vacuum / mop.
4. When finished, turn off the smartphone hotspot and turn on your home Wi-Fi again.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble try waiting a bit if it needs to find the hotspot network. If it's still not working check the hotspot settings. Ensure you're using a supported Wi-Fi band *(try 2.4 GHz if other options are unsupported by your device)*.

## In closing

Hope that helps get your device working!

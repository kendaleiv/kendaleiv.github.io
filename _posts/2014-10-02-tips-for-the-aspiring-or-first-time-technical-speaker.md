First of all, if you have an upcoming speaking engagement, congratulations on being selected!

If you don't have a speaking engagement yet, no worries. Now is a great low pressure time to learn, grow, and get comfortable speaking.

### Rehearse out loud

Deliver your talk aloud. Don't simply think about it, **vocalize it**.

If you're learning to play guitar, you need to learn to "keep up" and not stop to orient your fingers. Do the same with speaking. If you make a mistake, recover. Don't simply start over or give yourself too much thinking time. During your out-loud rehearsal proceed as though you have an audience, mistakes and all.

Spot opportunities for improvement while you're rehearsing audibly. Frequent *um's*, accidentally skipping or rushing through content, etc. are items you can work on, if necessary.

**Rehearse aloud until you are speaking comfortably, confidently, and fluently.**

### Follow your own style

If you're a rockstar, bring a guitar, crank it up, and jump into the audience *(actually, don't do any of those things)*. If you're a natural comedian, tell a joke. If you're a storyteller, perhaps open with a story of personal experience. **Be genuine. Be yourself.**

### Focus on the engaged audience

Try to avoid focusing on *that person* and derailing your own train of thought. Ignore those who aren't interested and don't let it get you down. Instead, **focus your attention and delivery on those who are fully engaged**.

### Equipment concerns

Ask about the presenting equipment available to you. If you intend to use a projector, find out what inputs are available *(if you don't already know)*. If it's VGA only, ensure you have A Way To VGA &trade;.

### Demos

If you plan to demo, pre-zoom your text. Know how to zoom in and out or adjust font sizes in applications used in demos. Learn to use magnification.

Be prepared if a demo goes completely and totally wrong. Have a working finished product you can fall back on, in case things don't go as planned.

### You don't have to know everything

If someone asks a question and you don't know the answer, no worries. Simply offer to connect with the individual later. If it's a small group with a conversation feel, perhaps an audience member knows the answer and would like to share.

### Relax and have fun

During your talk, you're the star of the show! Things may not go perfectly, but they'll likely go better if you're having a great time. Enjoy your `talkDurationInMinutes` minutes in the spotlight!

### Wrapup

If there's a speaker dinner or event, go! You've earned the right to attend. Celebrate!

Also, speaker badges make you feel amazing.

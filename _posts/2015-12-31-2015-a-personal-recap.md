I posted a personal recap [last year]({% post_url 2014-12-31-2014-a-personal-recap %}). Here's the same as a 2015 edition:

- I spoke at my first conference this year! In fact, I spoke at 7 conferences this year, as well as some other non-conference events! It's been an amazing experience traveling, meeting new people, and just having a blast. Thanks to everyone who inspired me to get this far!
- I bought a musical keyboard -- a 61 key MIDI controller. And, I lead my first-ever solo (small) Worship service using it!
- I got some internet points for authoring the Slack Chocolatey package. You may express your gratitude each time you `choco install slack` to my Twitter account *(not required, but, I wouldn't complain)*.
- I tracked around 250 miles on my Runkeeper account.

See you in 2016, internet!

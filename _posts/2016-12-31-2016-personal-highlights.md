I posted a personal recap [last year]({% post_url 2015-12-31-2015-a-personal-recap %}), and the [year before that]({% post_url 2014-12-31-2014-a-personal-recap %}). For this year, I'm calling it "2016: Personal Highlights":

- I received my first Microsoft MVP award in Visual Studio and Development Technologies. It's awesome to be recognized for my efforts!
- I spoke at my first international conference this year: [NDC Oslo](https://ndcoslo.com/). It was amazing to be selected for such a great opportunity! Looking forward to continuing to speak at conferences and events in the future. And, if you're interested, you can watch the talk I gave on Vimeo: [We Replaced a Multi-Application Home-Grown Authentication System](https://vimeo.com/171704608).
